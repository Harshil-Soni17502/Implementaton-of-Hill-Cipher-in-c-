# Implementaton-of-Hill-Cipher-in-c-
Hill cipher is a technique that is used to encrypt and decrypt messages in such a way that only the person who has the key can know what the actual message is. This can be used to transmit the messages in such a way that no can can understand what the message is except the person having the key. So this can be used for transmitting the messages secretly.
